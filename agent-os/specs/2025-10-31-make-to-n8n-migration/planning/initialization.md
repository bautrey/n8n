# Initial Feature Description

**Source:** KICKOFF.md
**Date:** 2025-10-31

## Project Objective

Build a complete n8n workflow automation environment that enables:
1. **Local Development**: Docker-based n8n instance with PostgreSQL
2. **Make.com Migration**: Tools to convert Make.com blueprints to n8n workflows
3. **Version Control**: Git-based workflow management with JSON files
4. **Production Deployment**: Render.com containerized deployment with persistent storage
5. **Claude Code Management**: Full programmatic workflow maintenance via CLI

## First Step Goal

The goal is ultimately to go get one Make scenario as our first step and get it running in a container that is able to do whatever n8n does.
